-slippery stuff should be harder to move on
-the zero gravity glitch should be fixed (haven't tested it)
-other small bug fixes

the reason you can't hear people in game is due to the servers. I don't pay for servers but I'm gonna have to start doing so. Your probably thinking what does that mean? It means I need to make money off of the game.

oops everyone has the vents
Anyway, feel free to report people in our discord (https://discord.gg/capuchin) See ya!
