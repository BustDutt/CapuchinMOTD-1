Hey! It's been a long time since the last update. I've been working on quite a lot since then. Here are some of the main things. You can check the discord for any of the smaller things I couldn't fit on here.
-new player model
-new gamemode
-new pc
-new moderator cosmetic that allows the mods to fly around the map
-bigger and more of a home like stump
-new scary monkey in the mines, he doesn't chase you, though he is quite scary
-new water splash effect
-changed some backend stuff to make thing run better
-cosmetic saving and color saving (so you can see peoples cosmetics and colors when you join. They can't see yours until you put them on again)
-bigger message of the day board
-made the glass sound less loud
-changed up the lighting a bit
-false ban should be less common
-made music for sand land
-new hidden secret in sand land
-the underneath feels creepier now
-small backend tweaks
-movement tweaks (should be harder to clip through stuff now).
Anyway, feel free to report people in our discord (https://discord.gg/capuchin) See ya!
