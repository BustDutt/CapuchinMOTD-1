Capuchin is getting a remake and shall be done in 1-4 months. Photon Voice is disabled until then due to high prices and not being able to afford them at the moment. Photon Pun (visuals, which allows you to see others) should be down at the end of this month. Get your goodbye's in now, because when we release the Capuchin Remake, it'll be so much better. See y'all there!
