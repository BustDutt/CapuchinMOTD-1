Hey New Update For The Horror Mode And some small stuff for the main map

-horror mode actually has an objective now
-3 horror monkeys
-changed vent to dirt in horror mode
-added mini-map
-AI will now sprint at you if they get close to you
-fixed zero gravity glitch
-fixed the issue where everyone had the vents

the reason you can't hear people in game is due to the servers. I don't pay for servers but I'm gonna have to start doing so. Your probably thinking what does that mean? It means I need to make money off of the game.
