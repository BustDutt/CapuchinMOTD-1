Hey it's me duttbust! The update includes some cool home like changes to the shop, the capuchins found the pedals of purple flowers and rubbed it on them to change their 
color and feel more fun. Maybe they will find more colors soon! a new design for the bridge the access all sides of the upper zone of the map. There is also 2 new boom boxes
that play music, try to find them both hidden around the maps. The slippery wall is now slippery. If you manage to get past the slippery spot, there is a barrier to block you
from leaving the map. Anyway, Enjoy the new update and feel free to report people in our discord (https://discord.gg/3ywTnTkGSu) See ya!
